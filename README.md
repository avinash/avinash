## Welcome to my Github page

My name is Avinash Meetoo and I live in Mauritius. When I was a kid, I was a computer geek and, when I grew up, I found it natural to study Computer Science (or, more precisely, Informatics). I am a fan of Linux and Open Source Software and I founded the Linux User Group of Mauritius in 2000.

I am a programmer.

Here is my personal [website](https://www.avinashmeetoo.com).
